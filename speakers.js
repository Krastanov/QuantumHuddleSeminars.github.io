"title": "Quantum optics toolbox for topological and correlated states of electrons",
"abstract": "We describe how various quantum optics techniques can be exploited to engineer both single-particle and effective interaction terms in solid-state systems. We start by electronic quantum Hall systems and show how optical selection rules are modified and how an effective interaction can be generated using an optical drive. We also investigate whether anyonic excitation can be optically generated and manipulated. Moreover, we discuss how patterned light can lead to superlattice structures for electrons, including flatland, kagome lattice, etc. In the end, we discuss how optical manipulation, such as optical pumping and bath engineering, could provide a new way to enhance superconductivity."

"title": "Optomechanics with a levitated nanoparticle",
"abstract": "Levitated optomechanics exploits the forces of light to suspend nanoscopic objects in vacuum. The light field serves both as a handle to mechanically manipulate, but also to interrogate various mechanical degrees of freedom of a levitated particle. In our talk, we introduce the audience to the field of levitated optomechanics, and discuss recent experimental progress towards full optomechanical control of the rotational and translational degrees of freedom of a levitated nanoparticle. In particular, we focus on feedback cooling a levitated particle’s motion to the few-phonon regime, where first signatures of its motional ground state emerge."

"title": "Photoinduced electron dynamics in metallic nanogaps from first principles calculations",
"abstract": "A nanoscale gap between two metallic nanoparticles is an ideal platform to exploit the interplay between electron currents and photonic excitations. The capability of a metallic gap to enhance the amplitude of the induced plasmonic field produces a variety of non-linear effects [1,2] which can be exploited in different applications in optoelectronics, such as optical rectification, light emission driven by DC currents, or high-harmonic generation, among others. Furthermore, in ultranarrow gaps, tunneling of electrons at optical frequencies has been found to screen the plasmonic bonding gap resonance, and activate a new distribution of optical modes characterized by optical charge transfer [3].
Here we address the complex dynamics of photoelectrons driven by single-cycle optical pulses in nanoscale gaps. By solving Schrödinger equation within the framework of Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory (TDDFT), the currents of the electrons photoemitted across the gap can be monitored, identifying ultrafast electron bursts where electron quiver occurs when the amplitude of the induced field at the plasmonic gap is reversed within the optical cycle. The properties of the amplitude and carrier-envelope phase (CEP) of the incident pulse, together with the gap length determine the complex electron dynamics [4,5,6]. 
Experimental measurements of the current autocorrelations for pairs of such pulses with controlled relative delay between them, confirms the ultrafast dynamics of the photoelectrons in the gap and its complexity.
